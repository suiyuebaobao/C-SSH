## v0.5 - Branding Refresh and Stable Packages

### Downloads
- Windows installer: `Creation-SSH_0.1.0_x64-setup.exe`
- Windows MSI: `Creation-SSH_0.1.0_x64_en-US.msi`
- Windows portable: `Creation-SSH-portable-Windows-x64.zip`
- Android arm64: `C-SSH-android-arm64.apk`
- Android AAB: `C-SSH-android-arm64.aab`

### Added
- New brand C icon: dark glass background with a metallic silver C, unified across desktop, Android launcher icons, and in-app branding.
- Public release notes are now bilingual, with GitHub Releases serving as the version update list.
- Expanded internal handoff, architecture, protocol, release, testing, code map, and code index documentation.

### Fixed
- Fixed Android release icon synchronization so launcher, foreground, and round icons no longer keep the old artwork.
- Fixed missing Android `splash_window_bg` resource so release and debug builds package correctly.
- Fixed clippy blocking the AI session entry point by replacing an oversized argument list with a structured `RunRequest`.
- Documented the boundary between the private source repository and the public promotion repository to avoid leaking APKs, promo archives, credentials, screenshots, or logs into the source repo.

### Verified
- Rust fmt, clippy, and workspace tests passed.
- Windows desktop release build passed.
- Android arm64 release APK passed signature, package name, SDK, and ABI checks.
- Android x86_64 debug build was smoke-tested on the emulator for cold start and main-screen rendering.
- Sanitization checked before publishing: no real IPs, credentials, or test-server details.

## v0.4 - Desktop and Android

### Added
- First public Windows desktop installers.
- Improved Android splash animation to reduce white flash and main-screen flicker.
- Fixed Android app icon to use a full dark-base C.
- AI assistant supports OpenAI-compatible APIs and Anthropic.
